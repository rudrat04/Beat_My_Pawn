# ChessBot
This repository contains a Python-based reinforcement learning project focused on developing a chess-playing AI. The project uses object-oriented programming principles to represent the chess board and pieces, and implements a custom rule-checking system to validate moves. The AI uses reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal strategies.

This project was developed in conjunction with Generative AI tools. These advanced technologies assisted in various aspects of the project, from generating initial code snippets to optimizing algorithms and refining the final product. The use of AI has greatly enhanced the projectâ€™s efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating the potential of AI in software development.
